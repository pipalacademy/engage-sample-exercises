# Two-highest

Write a function `two_highest` that takes a list of numbers and returns the highest and second-highest as a tuple.

You can assume that the list will always have at least 2 elements.

Example:

```python
>>> two_highest([2, 4, 12, 10, 8])
(12, 10)
>>> two_highest([-10, -5, 0, -2, -3])
(0, -2)
```
